# Cloud Identity

Cloud Identity is an Identity as a Service (IDaaS) solution that centrally manages users and groups. 

Features:
- can configure Cloud Identity to federate identities between Google and other identity providers, such as Active Directory and Azure Active Directory.
- CI gives you more control over the accounts that are used in your organization, f.e. over personal accounts, such as Gmail accounts - when you adopt Cloud Identity, you can manage access and compliance across all users in your domain via creation of a Cloud Identity account for each of your users and groups. You can then use Identity and Access Management (IAM) to manage access to Google Cloud resources for each Cloud Identity account.

# Identity and Access Management

In Identity and Access Management (IAM), access is granted through allow policies, also known as IAM policies. An allow policy is attached to a Google Cloud resource. Each allow policy contains a collection of role bindings that associate one or more principals, such as users or service accounts, with an IAM role.
