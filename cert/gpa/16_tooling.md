# CLI tooling short reference

# Common operations

## kubectl

This is the syntax to run kubectl commands from console:

```
kubectl [command] [TYPE] [NAME] [flags]
```

where command, TYPE are:

command: Specifies the operation that you want to perform on one or more resources, for example `create`, `get`, `describe`, `delete`.

TYPE: Specifies the resource type, normally it's a noun in a plural form (but this is only in general)

## Examples

kubectl apply - Apply or Update a resource from a file or stdin.

Create a service using the definition in example-service.yaml.

```
kubectl apply -f example-service.yaml
```

Create a replication controller using the definition in example-controller.yaml.

```
kubectl apply -f example-controller.yaml
```

Create the objects that are defined in any .yaml, .yml, or .json file within the <directory> directory.

```
kubectl apply -f <directory>
```


kubectl get - List one or more resources.

List all pods in plain-text output format.

```
kubectl get pods
```

List all pods in plain-text output format and include additional information (such as node name).

```
kubectl get pods -o wide
```

## gsutil

some commands have a linux bash equivalent, such as `ls`, `cat`, etc 

- acl - operations with default object ACLs
- bucketpolicyonly -  is used to retrieve or configure the uniform bucket-level access setting of Cloud Storage buckets 
- cat
- compose - creates a new object whose content is the concatenation of a given sequence of source objects under the same bucket
- config - the gsutil config command obtains access credentials for Cloud Storage and writes a boto/gsutil configuration file containing the obtained credentials along with a number of other configuration-controllable values.
- cors - gets or sets the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) configuration on one or more buckets.
- cp
- defacl - manipulations with default object ACLs for the specified buckets
- defstorageclass - operations with default storage class for the specified bucket(s)
- du - displays the amount of space in bytes used up by the objects in a bucket, subdirectory, or project.
- hash
- help
- hmac
- iam - is used to get, set, or change bucket and/or object IAM permissions
- kms - is used to configure Cloud Storage and Cloud KMS resources to support encryption of Cloud Storage objects with Cloud KMS keys
- label - to do label configuration (also called the tagging configuration by other storage providers) of one or more buckets
- lifecycle -  to get or set lifecycle management policies for a given bucket.
- logging -  Usage/Storage logs provide information for all of the requests made on a specified bucket and are created hourly/daily.
- ls
- mb
- mv
- notification -  to configure Pub/Sub notifications for Cloud Storage and Object change notification channels (OBJECT_FINALIZE - An object has been created, OBJECT_METADATA_UPDATE - The metadata of an object has changed, OBJECT_DELETE - An object has been permanently deleted, OBJECT_ARCHIVE - A live version of an object has become a noncurrent version.)
- pap -  is used to retrieve or configure the public access prevention setting of Cloud Storage buckets.
- perfdiag
- rb
- requesterpays
- retention - configures a data retention policy for a Cloud Storage bucket that governs how long objects in the bucket must be retained. 
- rewrite -  rewrites cloud objects, applying the specified transformations to them (add, rotate, or remove encryption keys on objects,  to specify a new storage class for objects.)
- rm
- rpo
- rsync - makes the contents under dst_url the same as the contents under src_url, by copying any missing files/objects (or those whose data has changed), and (if the -d option is specified) deleting any extra files/objects. 
- setmeta
- signurl - generates a signed URL that embeds authentication data so the URL can be used by someone who does not have a Google account
- stat
- test
- ubla
- update
- version
- versioning
- web - allows to configure a bucket to behave like a static website when the bucket is accessed through a custom domain.

## Examples

```
gsutil signurl -d 10m <private-key-file> gs://<bucket>/<object>
gsutil -i <service account email> signurl -d 10m -u gs://<bucket>/<object>
gsutil web set [-m <main_page_suffix>] [-e <error_page>] gs://<bucket_name>
```

If an object is shared publicly, you can also view that object with the URL:  http://storage.googleapis.com/BUCKET_NAME/OBJECT_NAME

For example, the URL for an index.html object would be:  http://storage.googleapis.com/www.example.com/index.html
